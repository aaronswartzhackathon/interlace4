Interlace Teleputer Systems For Home, Office, Or Mobile

== Installation

Requires CouchDB 1.4 or greater.

http://couchdb.apache.org/ has binaries for Mac and Windows.

For Linux, if your package manager doesn't have a sufficiently recent version of Couch,
https://github.com/iriscouch/build-couchdb can help you build one from source.



git clone git://git.numm.org/interlace4
cd interlace4

On Mac, place "Apache CouchDB.app" in the interlace4 root directory;
on other platforms, create a symbolic link named "couchdb" to the "build" directory:

ln -s /PATH/TO/build-couchdb/build/ couchdb
(There may be permissions issues on a system-wide installation)

git submodule init
git submodule update



== Running InterLace

Once InterLace is installed, simply run:

python interlace.py
